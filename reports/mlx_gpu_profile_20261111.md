# MLX 50M GPU profile (2026-11-11)

## Workload

- 50M autoregressive transformer, MBS 8, gradient accumulation 8, sequence length 256
- Real `data/english_corpus_5b.bin`, 262,144 input tokens, 16 optimizer updates
- Apple M5 Pro, MLX 0.32.2; Xcode Metal System Trace
- Swap was already about 5.5 GiB used before the run.

## Measurements

- Training harness wall time: 8.96 s, about 29.3k input tokens/s including setup and trace launch.
- Sum of measured optimizer-step times: 8.19 s, about 32.0k input tokens/s within the measured steps; median step 0.497 s, last eight average 0.494 s.
- Peak MLX allocation: 1.67 GiB. System memory headroom was 37% at the final sample; swap usage stayed at 5.50 GiB during the run.
- System GPU telemetry had only two samples: device/renderer utilization was 35%/35% initially and 89%/76% at the final sample. These are system-wide samples, not process-specific averages.
- The trace contained 40,520 GPU activity intervals and 8,474 command-buffer completion events. Its Metal shader timeline was disabled, so the shader interval table contained no rows or kernel names.

## Interpretation and limits

The run reached high system GPU activity while training and used 1.67 GiB of MLX-managed memory. This does not establish sustained GPU saturation: telemetry was sparse and system-wide. The capture cannot identify which MLX kernels dominate or distinguish compute, memory-bandwidth, and launch-overhead limits. No Neural Engine occupancy counter was captured.

The next useful profile must enable Metal shader timeline or GPU counters and collect enough samples to attribute GPU time to kernels. The attempted counter-table export grew past 268 MB while free swap fell to about 327 MB; it was stopped to protect memory headroom. No second training run was started.
